Hello, I am **Sriram Ramesh**!
You can use the following things to start a conversation with me:

*Coffee*

*Books*

*Finance*

*PC Building*

*Photography*

*Table Tennis*

*Legend of Zelda*

*Apple vs Android :)*

*The country - Qatar*

*Soccer - Football for me ;)*

You can have a day's worth of conversation with me on any one of the above topics, hehe.

my favorite quote is

> *Change the plan but never the goal.* 

Which just goes on to say that we can never lose sight of our vision.
